# Calvin-Nursing-VR-Project
This project was completed for my STAT245 class, in collaboration with two of my classmates, under the guidance of Professor Katherine Kunnen from the Calvin Nursing Department. Our primary aim was to analyze the impact of virtual reality (VR) experiences on nursing students' confidence in conducting health assessments.
