# Calvin Nursing VR Project

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project was completed for my STAT245 class, in collaboration with two of my classmates, Ha Dong Park and Alex Miller, under the guidance of Professor Katherine Kunnen from the Calvin Nursing Department. Our primary aim was to analyze the impact of virtual reality (VR) experiences on nursing students' confidence in conducting health assessments. We conducted a pre-survey before the nursing simulation experience and a post-survey afterward, where students answered questions to determine if their confidence levels were influenced by the VR experience.

INTRODUCTION

In this project, we focused on two main research questions:

How do different time points affect students' confidence in their health assessments?
Does prior VR experience impact their confidence in health assessments?
DATA

We gathered data from pre-surveys and post-surveys conducted with nursing students before and after their VR simulation experiences. The survey responses were then processed into numerical formats for statistical analysis.

STATISTICAL MODELING

We employed two linear regression models to investigate the effects of Time Points and Simulation Experiences on nursing students' confidence and knowledge in health assessments. These models helped us explore whether the timing and nature of VR experiences influenced students' confidence levels. Throughout this project, I used R and learned to utilize specific libraries such as ggformula for our data visualization and analysis.

MAIN FINDINGS

Our analysis highlighted the significance of timing in enhancing nursing students' confidence in health assessments. We found that confidence levels were notably higher immediately after the VR experience, emphasizing the importance of assessment timing. However, prior VR experiences did not significantly affect confidence levels, suggesting that the immediate timing of the VR assessment is more crucial for confidence improvement.

OUR EXPERIENCE

Throughout this project, we faced several challenges, including:

Accurately inputting survey data into a spreadsheet.
Converting and manipulating data into numerical formats.
Calculating averages and other statistical measures.
We also encountered difficulties in coordinating team meetings due to time constraints, but we successfully resolved this through effective communication. Despite these challenges, we gained valuable knowledge in statistical modeling and data analysis, which helped us draw meaningful conclusions from our study.

REFERENCES & ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We extend our gratitude to Professor Kunnen for providing the dataset and organizing the project, allowing us to explore the effects of VR on nursing confidence. We also thank Professor DeRuiter for her assistance with data challenges and explaining complex concepts, which was incredibly valuable for our project.
